                    The United Kingdom has had a significant film industry for over a century. While film production reached an all-time high in 1936,
                    the "golden age" of British cinema is usually thought to have occurred in the 1940s, during which the directors David Lean, Michael Powell, (with Emeric Pressburger) and Carol Reed produced their most critically acclaimed works.
